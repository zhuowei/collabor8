<h1>Collabor8: the worst game ever made</h1>
<p>Collabor8 is not a deep abstract game causing you to reevaluate your intention of play. 
Nor is it about the sharing of information in this digital age. Still not about the impact of scarcity and uniqueness as experienced in limited editions.
No, it isn't about trying to troll various Twitter users either. Or a discussion of potential rewards.</p>
<p>No, this game is just the result of one dumb idea and two days of coding.</p>
<p><strong>There will only be 32 copies of the game ever distributed.</strong></p>
<p>Each copy is unique, and you can only download one copy.</p>
<p>System requirements: An Android device with Installation from Unknown Sources enabled, 5 MB of free space on device and on external storage, patience</p>
<p>You ready?</p>

<p>Like this game? This is just the first stupid product created as part of my Operations project. Following the lead of ChrisMCMine, though not as well,
I will strive to bring to life one dumb idea per week.</p>
